## Credits

- Project from the Udemy course: _JavaScript Tutorial and Projects Course (2022)_ by John Smilga

The current project is based on the one that appears in the credits, but it is not exactly the same, since it incorporates small adaptations and personal experimentation's like: BEM names for CSS and HTML; restructured html elements for HTML; and format the object date instead of user de Moment.js library in JS.
