  The current project is based on the one that appears in the credits, but it is not exactly the same, since it incorporates small adaptations and personal experimentation's like: first mobile, BEM, Animation and responsive design for CSS and HTML; and IIFE, objects and functionality programming for JS; also the HTML tags and CSS class have been restructured.
