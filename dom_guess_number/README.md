## Credits

- Project from the Udemy course: _The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!_ by Jonas Schmedtmann

The current project is based on the one that appears in the credits, but it is not exactly the same, since it incorporates small adaptations and personal experimentation's like: first mobile and responsive design for CSS and HTML; and IIFE, objects and functionality programming for JS; also a form to use the Enter key as associated with check button.
