# Fetch quotes from a public API

<img src="./data/screenshot_desktop.jpg" width="350">

A basic page to practice API FETCH to request single quotes (in this case, jokes)

- 🎯 Main Goal: Work with JS to change the data displayed on the page by the user, requesting new data from the server each time.
- 🕹️ Live Demo: [link](https://orses.github.io/vanilla_javascript/fetch_dad_jokes/src/)
- 🔵 Level: Newbie

## Credits

- Project from: Udemy course "JavaScript tutorial and Projects Course 2022" by John Smilga

  The current project is based on the one that appears in the credits, but it is not exactly the same, since it incorporates small adaptations and personal experimentations like

  - the attribution on HTML and CSS
  - the mobile design
  - using a different organization for files and functions on JS.
